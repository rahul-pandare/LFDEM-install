	abstract = {The resistance functions that relate the forces, couples, and stresslets exerted on ambient fluid by two unequal rigid spheres in low Reynolds number flow are calculated for the case in which the spheres are immersed in an ambient linear flow. In conjuction with earlier works, this paper completes the tabulation of all of the two‐sphere resistance functions at present needed in investigations of the mechanics of suspensions. Each function is calculated first as a series in inverse powers of the center‐to‐center separation, and then, in order to handle the singular behavior caused by lubrication forces, the asymptotic form which the function takes when the spheres are close is combined with the series expansion into a single expression valid for all separations of the spheres.},

	abstract = {A new Stokesian dynamics ({SD}) algorithm for Brownian suspensions is presented. The implementation is based on the recently developed accelerated Stokesian dynamics ({ASD}) simulation method [Sierou and Brady, J. Fluid Mech. 448, 115 (2001)] for non-Brownian particles. As in {ASD}, the many-body long-range hydrodynamic interactions are computed using fast Fourier transforms, and the resistance matrix is inverted iteratively, in order to keep the computational cost O(N log N). A fast method for computing the Brownian forces acting on the particles is applied by splitting them into near- and far-field contributions to avoid the O(N 3 ) computation of the square root of the full resistance matrix. For the near-field part, representing the forces as a sum of pairwise contributions reduces the cost to O(N); and for the far-field part, a Chebyshev polynomial approximation for the inverse of the square root of the mobility matrix results in an O(N 1.25 log N) computational cost. The overall scaling of the method is thus roughly of O(N 1.25 log N) and makes possible the simulation of large systems, which are necessary for studying long-time dynamical properties and/or polydispersity effects in colloidal dispersions. In this work the method is applied to study the rheology of concentrated colloidalsuspensions, and results are compared with conventional {SD}. Also, a faster approximate method is presented and its accuracy discussed.},

	abstract = {Methods are presented for the simulation of conformational relaxation processes in polymer chains. The chains interact with the solvent through frictional and Langevin forces, have constrained bond lengths and angles, and smooth rotational energy functions. Relationships are obtained between the stochastic difference equations that form the basis for computer simulation, and equivalent Langevin differential equations and Smoluchowski diffusionequations. The presence of constraints and the associated action of potential forces and Langevin forces on the same time scale leads to somewhat intricate algorithms and correction terms. However, the time increment during a simulation step can be increased by a factor of 1000 or more over what is required if vibrational potentials are used to preserve the primary chain structure. Computation time is proportional to chain length in the absence of hydrodynamic interaction and excluded volume forces.},

	abstract = {We report on details of a simulation technique for particles under quasi-static motion determined by a balance of conservative and dissipative interactions acting at the pair level. We develop frame-invariant and linear viscous interactions between pairs of translating and rotating spheres in a form suitable for computation. We report an o(N) method for generating Brownian forces correlated with a pair resistance tensor and show how explicit finite difference schemes lead naturally to an algorithm with Brownian motion and an estimate of the Brownian stress. We justify the algorithm by appeal to the second-order Langevin equation. We discuss the choice of time step and imposition of boundary conditions. We assess a model of this kind as an approximation for colloid spheres concentrated in a fluid medium under shear flow. It is noted that the algorithm is also that required for simulation, in the diffusive limit, of a technique known as dissipative particle dynamics. We report on structural effects in Brownian sphere colloids and their sensitivity to the model details. We argue that the approximation has heuristic value in the study of the rheology in concentrated colloid systems. Its predictions for the rheology of suspensions are in semi-quantitative agreement with experiment.},
