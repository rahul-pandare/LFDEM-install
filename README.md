# LFDEM-install
Instructions to install the Lubricated flow discrete element method (LF-DEM).
LF-DEM is a code written by Romain Mari and Ryohei Seto (Mari et al. 2024, https://doi.org/10.1122/1.4890747). 
LF-DEM simulates dense, overdamped, neutrally boyant suspensions with spherical, bidisperse particles under simple shear. Rheological and interation information can be obtained from the LF-DEM code.
Here I mention the LF-DEM installation and bebugging steps for personal linux, personal mac, linux cluster systems and AWS EC2 instance.
